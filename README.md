# Handwritting Recognition (HWR) ✍️
# Abstract
In order to obtain our License degree in Mathematic and Computer Science, we carried out this project.
Briefly, its goal consists of learning and understanding the bases of objects recognition in imagery using **multilayer neural networks with or without convolution**.
To make this project successfull, we began by *defining the problem*.
Once done, we were able to understand the purpose of objects recognition precisely in the context of handwriting and then to fix from that the solutions. Then, we chose as the dataset MNIST which contains a set of digits in different fonts, which we used to train our model by supervised learning. Finally, after multiple training sessions, we tested our application to ensure that the predictions of the latter were satisfactory. This study allowed us to put all of our knowledge of Artificial Intelligence into a practical framework. . It has enabled us to understand how computers acquire and process handwriting images.
